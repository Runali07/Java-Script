The Student Registration Form is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It collects student details such as Full Name, Email Address, and Age and performs client-side validation to ensure correct input before submission.

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of form handling, DOM manipulation, validation logic, and user-friendly UI design.
